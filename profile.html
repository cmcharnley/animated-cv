                    <p id="profilecontent">I am a Masters qualified, highly driven individual, always determined to work to the best of my ability. I have 9 years public sector/local government experience, and have spent the last 3 years working in the private sector for ao.com, which prove my adaptibility, and have equipped me with a range of working styles, organisational skills and made me an excellent communicator.   I have taken the first steps in starting my career as a Front End Developer, and I am currently enrolled on a 3 month coding BootCamp. By July 2019 I will be fully competent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and have experience of Node.js, React.js, and iOS Swift. You can find out more on my LinkedIn page!</p>
